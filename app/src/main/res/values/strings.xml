        <b>How To Play</b> \n
        The game functions as a real life snake game. \n
        By walking around in the real world, you will be able to see that your movement
        is being tracked on the screen. \n
        The purpose of the game is to gather as many cheese objects
        as you can before the timer runs out. The faster you collect the cheese, the more points
        you get. \n
        For each piece of cheese that is picked up, your tail grows in size. \n
        But be careful! If you run into yourself, you die and the game is over. You will
        also die if you stand still for too long after picking up a cheese, so keep moving at all times
        to reach a greater highscore!
